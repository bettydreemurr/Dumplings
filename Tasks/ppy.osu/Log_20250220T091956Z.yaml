    New release!
    Importantly, if you're one of those reading release notes here on github, we're changing up the format a bit. Now, all merged PRs will be listed here, rather than the edited version. If you prefer to read my curated changelog, head over to the usual place on the osu! website.
    The curated changelog will now have anything not interesting to end users removed. I'm opting to keep the full list here on github to give everyone involved in making the release happened the credit they deserve, while making the actual user facing changelog a lot more relevant.
